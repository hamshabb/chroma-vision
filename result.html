      <h3>About Color Blindness</h3>
      <p>Color blindness affects at least an estimated 4% of the global population. Rates are higher in some demographics than others, and are more than 10 times higher in males.<br>Color blindness is caused by defects in the <bold>cone cells</bold> of the eye-- 
        either inherited (on the X-chromosome) or caused by certain diseases or chemical exposures. There are several types of cone cells, and different
        types of color blindness associated with each. <bold>Red-Green Colorblindness</bold> is the most common type (more than one in 15 males in the US has
        some form of red-green color blindness-- compared with roughly one in 200 females). Color blindness is not curable, but specialized lenses can allow for
        a greatly increased range of color vision.<br>In the US, color vision impairment is not covered by the American Disabilities Act.
