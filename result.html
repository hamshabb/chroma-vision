              <h3>How Common Is Color Blindness?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
              <p><bold>Red-Green Colorblindness</bold> is the most common type. Red-Green colorblindness is inherited recessively on the X-chromosome, leading to different rates for males and females--more than one in 15 males in the US has some form of red-green color blindness compared with roughly one in 200 females. Other types of color blindness are much rarer. </p>

              <h3>What Causes Color Blindess?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
              <p>Color blindness is caused by defects in the <bold>cone cells</bold> of the eye-- 
                either inherited  or caused by certain diseases, injuries, or chemical exposures. There are three types of cone cells that react to Red, Green, or Blue light, and different types of color blindness are associated with each.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
              <p>Depending on which types of cone cells are deficient, different colors may be more or less difficult to distinguish. The main categories are: Protanopia/ -anomaly is inability or difficulty to see Red; Deuteranopia/ -anomaly is inability or difficulty to see Green; Tritanopia/ -anomaly is inability or difficulty to see blue;Monochromacy is a very rare total lack of color vision affecting fewer than 1 in 30,000 people globally.</p>

              <h3>Are There Treatments?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="flip-card-back">
              <p>Color blindness is not curable-- though it is possible for damage caused by chemical exposures to be recovered from. Specialized lenses that increase color saturation can improve color vision in some people, but early trials suggest that it helps fewer than 50% of those diagnosed as color blind.</p>

              <p><bold>Protanopia</bold> is a more severe (and rarer) form of Red-Green colorblindness that makes one unable to distinguish red colors from green colors at all due to nonfunctional red receptor cones.</p>

              <p><bold>Deuteranomaly</bold> is the most common type of color blindness, and is commonly referred to as "Red-Green Colorblindness." Deuteranomaly is experienced as a difficulty in distinguishing green hues from red hues-- so greens "look more red" and have reduced contrast.</p>

              <p><bold>Tritanopia</bold> -- or "Blue-Yellow Colorblindness"-- is an difficulty to distinguish colors in blue ranges from one another, and likewise for yellow ranges. About 1% of people have some form of Tritanopia. The genes for Tritanopia are distinct from those that cause Deuteranomaly, so rates are the same for males and females.</p>
