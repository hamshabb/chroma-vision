        <p>My name is Shane Roach, I am currently studying to become a software developer. I come from a mixed background
          of engineering, art, and design; which have ultimately shaped how I view the world. Considering my biggest
          passions are making visually stunning, engaging experiences for people, I aim to find a position within tech
          that best allows me to apply my skill set. </p>

        <p>My name is Hambalieu Jallow but I go by Jallow. I am originally from Gambia, but I have been living in Seattle for the past 6 years. I have been driving for Uber for the past 6 years  but it became stressful and less rewarding especially during the pandemic. I decided I needed to find a career that I enjoy and more rewarding than my current job so I could be able to take care of myself and my family. During this research I came across Software Development. I have always wanted to understand how technology functions and how some of those technologies are created. A career in Software development will give me the knowledge to understand how some of these technologies are built and as well as how they function.</p>
