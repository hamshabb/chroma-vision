          My name is Shane Roach, I am currently studying to become a software developer. I come from a mixed background
          of engineering, art, and design; which have ultimately shaped how I view the world. Considering my biggest
          passions are making visually stunning, engaging experiences for people, I aim to find a position within tech
          that best allows me to apply my skill set. <a id="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-roach-908987226/">LinkedIn</a>

          <p class="about-box" id="jallow-text"> <img src="img/Jallow.JPG" alt="Photo of Jallow Hambalieu" id="portrait">
            My name is Hambalieu Jallow but I go by Jallow. I am originally from Gambia, but I have been living in Seattle
            for the past 6 years. I have been driving for Uber for the past 6 years but it became stressful and less
            rewarding especially during the pandemic. I decided I needed to find a career that I enjoy and more rewarding
            than my current job so I could be able to take care of myself and my family. During this research I came
            across Software Development. I have always wanted to understand how technology functions and how some of those
            technologies are created. A career in Software development will give me the knowledge to understand how some
            of these technologies are built and as well as how they function.

          biology, but I love learning about new fields. I'm a student developer hoping to get into the Seattle-area
          tech workforce in the coming year. I'm excited to learn and apply more coding skills for a career that
          challenges my critical thinking.<a id="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robb-alexander/">LinkedIn</a>
