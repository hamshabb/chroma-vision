        <p>My name is Hambalieu Jallow but I go by Jallow. I am originally from Gambia, but I have been living in Seattle for the past 6 years. I have been driving for Uber for the past 6 years but it became stressful and less rewarding especially during the pandemic. I decided I needed to find a career that I enjoy and <note>"is"?</note> more rewarding than my current job so I could be able to take care of myself and my family. During this research I came across Software Development. I have always wanted to understand how technology functions and how some of those technologies are created. A career in Software development will give me the knowledge to understand how some of these technologies are built and as well as how they function.</p>
