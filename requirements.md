# Software Requirements

## Vision Statement

**Chroma Vision** will serve as a basic, highly accessible color blindness app. **CV** will both serve as an educational tool and experience to build better **understanding** of and **empathy** for color vision impairment. **CV** will also serve to increase **awareness** of **accessibility** in design for visually impaired users.

## Scope

### In

* Test color vision using established Ishihara test framework

* Provide information on varieties of color vision impairment

* Display user test results compared to national color impairment averages

* Maximized accessibiility in UI and presentation to be as inclusive as possible

### Out

* Will *not* claim diagnosis

* Will *not* link to medical professionals directly

## Minimum Viable Product

* Static images with simple background that is not distracting

* User scoring captured with HTML forms and saved into local storage

* Maximized accessibility in visual design

* Information about color blindness (presented to a general audience)

## Stretch Goals

* Form to collect user demographic data to dynamically compare test results to hard-coded national averages

* Provide examples of the experience of colorblindness through side-by-side comparison images

* Dynamic Test: images based on current user scores in different color-blindness categories

* CSS animations & styling (including dynamic progress bar for test)

## Functional Requirements

* User is displayed one image at a time until text input for previous image is submitted. Submitted input is saved locally and JS code is used to output test results in text/chart form

* On a separate linked page, user views their results (or message telling them to take the test for comparison data) as well as national averages and information on color blindness

* User can view a separate linked page with basic biographical data on deveopers
